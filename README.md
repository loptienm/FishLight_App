=========

This is an Android App to control the FishLight project.  This should be able to setup the Spark Core to connect to the WIFI, turn on and off a number of 12V and AC devices (pumps, solenoids, fans, heaters, filters, etc.), change the brightness of the LED light, read the current temperature of the fishtank, perform water changes and top offs, set the desired amount of current to provide to each LED string and read the amount of current being used at any given time, and any other features that I may be able to think of.
